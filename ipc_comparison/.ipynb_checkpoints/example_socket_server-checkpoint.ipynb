    "\n",
    "> **TLDR:** When setting up sockets, you need a (1) an address family, (2) a socket type, and a (3) address. We use `AF_UNIX` addresses and `SOCK_STREAM` sockets.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> For the (1) address type, use `AF_INET` for most applications, and `socket.AF_UNIX` for inter-process communications on Unix machines. (We use `AF_UNIX`.)\n",
    "> \n",
    "> For (2) socket type, we use the `SOCK_STREAM` socket type (which is TCP-style). You may also see `socket.SOCK_DGRAM` for UDP-style sockets, which do not implement `listen()`.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> For (3) the address, Unix addresses (`AF_UNIX`) are filenames (e.g. `./my_socket.lalala` (but do not involve disk IO), while `AF_INET` addresses are IP addresses, e.g. `127.0.0.1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we import `socket` and `struct`, and also set up certain constants we use. For a more detailed explanation, [see this tutorial from PyMOTW](https://pymotw.com/3/socket/addressing.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The **address family** tells the socket what type of address to look for. Here are the three main address types:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Adress family | Description |\n",
    "| - | - |\n",
    "| `AF_INET` | Internet (IPv4) addresses. Most popular socket. |\n",
    "| | When testing `AF_INET` on a local machine, use address `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` |\n",
    "| `AF_INET6` | IPv6 addresses. Will be useful once IPv6 is more widely used! | \n",
    "| `AF_UNIX` | Unix domain socket addresses. These are what we will use. :) |\n",
    "\n",
    "Other address types exist, such as Bluetooth, for ATMs, amateur radio, and old discontinued technologies like AppleTalk or X.25.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **socket type** describes how the socket operates. Here are some socket types:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Socket type | Description |\n",
    "| - | - |\n",
    "| `SOCK_STREAM` | TCP-style connections, implementing `listen()`. These are what we will use. :) |\n",
    "| `SOCK_SEQPACKET` | Similar to `SOCK_STREAM`, but for one-to-many rather than one-to-one connections |\n",
    "| `SOCK_DGRAM` | UDP-style connections. |\n",
    "| `SOCK_RAW` | Raw access to IP. (You may have seen this in a networking class.) |\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also specify an address. With `AF_INET` addresses, we use IP addresses or URLs, e.g. `127.0.0.1`, `localhost`, `www.python.org`, etc. But with `AF_UNIX` addresses, we use filenames, e.g. `some_filename.sock`. Despite how this will appear, data transfered over a socket is done in-memory, and does not involve disk I/O!"
